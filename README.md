Practice test problems for Introduction to Computer Science I course

The .py files in this repository are solutions to some of the practice test problems for my Introduction to Computer Science I course.

pt1q1-compare-circumferences.py outputs which of two circumferences is larger, given two diameters.

pt1q4-draw-pattern.py draws a particular pattern.

pt2q1-round-ceiling.py rounds floating point numbers up to the nearest integer.

pt2q3-reverse-upper-ascii.py takes a list of characters, and returns a list of ASCII codes for all uppercase characters, in the reverse of the order of the original list.

pt2q4-morse-code-converter.py converts from Morse code to Latin text.

pt2q5v1.py and pt2q5v2.py are different versions of the same solution. Both programs take a list of integers and generate a two-dimensional list of random even integers from the original list.
